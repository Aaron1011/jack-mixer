A simple mixer to allow me to use my midi controller (Novation LaunchControl XL) on linux and also to explore the new druid ui.

This app requires jack, but the midi support is optional.

# TODO

 - The filters for the knobs (low, mid, high). Use convoluation filters.
 - Learn how to write convoluation filters and use them in realtime threads.
 - UI improvements.
