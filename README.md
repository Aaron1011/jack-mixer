A simple volume widget for jack audio.

You can see what command line options there are by running `jack-volume -h`.

You'll need fairly recent `gtk` libraries, and the jack client library of course.

There are 3 ways to update the volume: via the command line, a gtk interface, or a midi controller.

The project is (IMHO) well documented, and also feel free to open issues to ask questions.
